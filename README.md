## About
**Expandable RecyclerView** is a library written to allow for an expanded view to be attached to each `ViewHolder`. To allow for full functionality of a normal `RecyclerView`, the `RecyclerView` has been modified to use two types of ViewHolders, a child and a parent with the ability to customize each separately.

##Project Setup
**Gradle**

The [latest release](https://github.com/bignerdranch/expandable-recycler-view/releases/tag/v2.0.4) can be used by adding the following to your app's build.gradle:
```gradle
compile 'com.bignerdranch.android:expandablerecyclerview:2.0.4'
```

## Overview
**Expandable RecyclerView** can be used with any stock Android `RecyclerView`. Javadocs can be found [here](http://bignerdranch.github.io/expandable-recycler-view/).

**What you need to implement:**
- A custom adapter that extends `ExpandableRecyclerAdapter`
- Two custom ViewHolders: a parent `ViewHolder` that extends `ParentViewHolder` and a child `ViewHolder` that extends `ChildViewHolder`
- The list of objects you wish to display in your RecyclerView must extend `ParentListItem`.
  - It is best practice to separate your child data into its own `Object`, although it is not required.
- A parent layout and a child layout

You can also check out the two sample applications for a full working demo of the features.

## Usage
First, create a stock `RecyclerView` in your layout file and inflate it in your `Activity`/`Fragment` as you would usually do.
 
Next, create an adapter that extends `ExpandableRecyclerAdapter`. Implement the required methods.
 
Then, create two ViewHolders and their respective layouts. One `ViewHolder` must extend `ParentViewHolder` and the other must extend `ChildViewHolder`. Create their respective views and create variables in these ViewHolders to access those views.
 
Next, the `Object` that contains the data to be displayed in your `RecyclerView` must extend `ParentListItem`. When you implement `ParentListItem`, there are three methods that you must implement, shown in the example below:

```java
public class CustomParent implements ParentListItem {
    
    private List<CustomChild> mChildItemList;

    /* Your constructors, variables, data and methods for your Object go here */

    /**
     * You can either return a newly created list of children here or attach them later
     */
    @Override
    public List<CustomChild> getChildItemList() {
        return mChildItemList;
    }

    /**
     * Allows you to specify if the list item should be expanded when first shown to the user
     */
    @Override
    public boolean isInitiallyExpanded() {
        return false;
    }
}
```
When generating the list of parent list items, you should attach all children to them there. If the children share data with your `ParentListItem`, you can simply create a list of children in the constructor for your parent list item or in the getter method for the list.

In `onCreate()` or `onCreateView()` of your `Activity` or `Fragment`, create and attach your custom expandable adapter like so:
 
```java
RecyclerView mRecyclerView = (RecyclerView) findViewById(YOUR RECYCLERVIEW ID);
MyExpandable mExpandableAdapter = new MyExpandableAdapter(getActivity(), YOUR_PARENT_ITEM_LIST);
mRecyclerView.setAdapter(mExpandableAdapter);
mRecyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(this));
```

Inside your `ExpandableRecyclerAdapter`, you can create and bind your parent and child ViewHolders just as you would create and bind ViewHolders in a normal `RecyclerView`.
 
#### View Behaviors
You can define a custom button, image or view to trigger the expansion rather than clicking the whole item (default). To do this, your `ParentViewHolder` implementation should override `shouldItemViewClickToggleExpansion()` to return false. Then in your implementation set a click listener on your custom view and call `expandView()` to trigger the expansion or `collapseView()` to trigger a collapse.
 
You can also create your own animations for expansion by overriding `ParentViewHolder#onExpansionToggled(boolean)`, which will be called for you when the itemView is expanded or collapsed.

The `VerticalLinearRecyclerViewSampleActivity` sample shows a rotation animation in response to expansion changing. `HorizontalLinearRecyclerViewSampleActivity` sample shows defining your own click target for expansion.

You can even trigger expansion/collapse without ever clicking a list item. 
`ExpandableRecyclerAdapter` features `expandParent(int)` and `expandParent(ParentListItem)` to expand a list item by its adapter position or by its own reference. 
The same calls for collapsing list items can be found at `collapseParent(int)` and `collapseParent(ParentListItem)`. 
To expand or collapse all items in the list at once, we've provided `ExpandableRecyclerAdapter#expandAllParents()` and `ExpandableRecyclerAdapter#collapseAllParents()`.
 
#### Listening for Expansion and Collapsing
`ParentViewHolder#onExpansionToggled(boolean)` is useful for view changes, but if there are controller level changes (database persistence, web requests, etc.) you can listen for expansion and collapse events by implementing `ExpandableRecyclerAdapter.ExpandCollapseListener` in the `Activity` or `Fragment` hosting your `RecyclerView`. The interface contains two methods, `onListItemExpanded(int)` and `onListItemCollapsed(int)`. This will allow you to listen for expansion and collapse of list items. The position passed into these methods is the position of the item in the `ParentListItem` list. Any expanded children before the item are not included in that position index.

As an example, let's say we implemented `ExpandCollapseListener` in an activity. For this to work, after creating the adapter and before setting the RecyclerView's adapter, we must call `ExpandableRecyclerAdapter#setExpandCollapseListener(ExpandCollapseListener)` on the adapter:

```java
MyCustomExpandingAdapter myCustomExpandingAdapter = new MyCustomExpandingAdapter(this, parentList);
myCustomExpandingAdapter.setExpandCollapseListener(this);
mRecyclerView.setAdapter(myCustomExpandingAdapter);
```
 
#### Saving Expanded States onResume() or on Rotation
To save expanded/collapsed states, inside `#onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)` of your `Activity` or `Fragment`, call `myCustomExpandingAdapter.onSaveInstanceState(outState)`. In `onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle)`, call `myCustomExpandingAdapter.onRestoreInstanceState(savedInstanceState)`. Here is an example of how to override in your `Activity` or `Fragment`:
 
 ```java
  @Override
  protected void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {
      super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);
      outState = myCustomExpandingAdapter.onSaveInstanceState(outState);
  }

  @Override
  protected void onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
      super.onRestoreInstanceState(savedInstanceState);
      mExpandableAdapter.onRestoreInstanceState(savedInstanceState);
  }
 ```

#### Data Manipulation

 During the life of your `RecyclerView` you may need to add or remove items from the list. Please note that the traditional `notifyDataSetChanged()` of `RecyclerView.Adapter` do not work as intended.

 Instead we provide a set of notify methods to give you the ability to inform the adapter of changes to your list of `ParentListItem`s. They are:
 ```java
 // Parent Changes
 notifyParentItemInserted(int parentPosition)}
 notifyParentItemRemoved(int parentPosition)}
 notifyParentItemChanged(int parentPosition)}
 notifyParentItemRangeInserted(int parentPositionStart, int itemCount)}
 // Child Changes
 notifyChildItemInserted(int parentPosition, int childPosition)}
 notifyChildItemRemoved(int parentPosition, int childPosition)}
 notifyChildItemChanged(int parentPosition, int childPosition)}
 ```

 `HorizontalLinearRecyclerViewSampleActivity` has examples of these methods in action.

## Contributing
If you have an idea for a feature enhancement or a bug fix, we'd love to know! 
We handle issue tracking using GitHub's issue system, so feel free to add your comment there. We also welcome all pull requests.

The `dev` branch is used for future 2.X releases, so if you're adding a feature, we ask that you target the `dev` branch.
If you have a bug fix, targetting `master` is your best bet. This way, we're flexible to pull in bug fixes as soon as possible.
